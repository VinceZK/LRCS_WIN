#DB_ENV methods can also be specified using this configuration file. 
#If an environment home directory has been specified, 
#any file named DB_CONFIG in the database home directory will be 
#read for lines of the format NAME VALUE.

#One or more whitespace characters are used to delimit the two parts of the line, 
#and trailing whitespace characters are discarded. 
#All empty lines or lines whose first character is a whitespace or hash (#) character will be ignored.
